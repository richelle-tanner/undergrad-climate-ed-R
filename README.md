These files accompany the JCST article, "Using publicly-available long-term climate records in undergraduate interdisciplinary big data curriculum" (Tanner & Collins). For instructions on use, please see the R file header. 

CSV files are example formats for the R code, and work as-is with the script. PDFs are example plots from the R code.
